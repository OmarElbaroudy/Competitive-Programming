/*
   1- Cn is the number of Dyck words[2] of length 2n.
      A Dyck word is a string consisting of n X's and n Y's such that no initial segment of the string has more Y's than X's
   2- Cn is the number of different ways n + 1 factors can be completely parenthesized 
      (or the number of ways of associating n applications of a binary operator)
   3- It follows that Cn is the number of full binary trees with n + 1 leaves
   4- Cn is the number of monotonic lattice paths along the edges of a grid with n Ã— n square cells, 
      which do not pass above the diagonal
   5- The number of triangles formed in a convex polygon is n and the number of different ways that this can be achieved is Cn
